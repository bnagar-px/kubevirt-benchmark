# User Guide

## Testing Scenarios

The benchmark suite supports the following testing scenarios:

### 1. DataSource-Based VM Provisioning
Tests VM creation using KubeVirt DataSource cloning for efficient VM provisioning.

**Use Case**: Measure VM provisioning performance with your storage backend.

[Learn more →](datasource-clone.md)

### 2. Live Migration Testing
Tests VM live migration with existing VMs or by creating new VMs across different scenarios.

**Use Case**: Validates migration performance for node maintenance, load balancing, and disaster recovery scenarios.

[Learn more →](migration.md)

### 3. Capacity Benchmark Testing
Tests cluster capacity limits by running comprehensive VM operations in a loop until failure.

**Use Case**: Discover maximum VM capacity, test volume expansion limits, validate snapshot functionality, and stress-test the cluster.

[Learn more →](capacity-benchmark.md)

### 4. Failure and Recovery Testing
Tests VM recovery time after simulated node failures using Fence Agents Remediation (FAR).

**Use Case**: Validates high availability and disaster recovery capabilities.

[Learn more →](failure-recovery.md)

### 5. Cluster Validation
Validates that your OpenShift cluster is properly configured and ready to run KubeVirt performance tests.

**Use Case**: Pre-flight checks before running benchmarks.
