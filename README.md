# KubeVirt Performance Benchmarking Suite

[![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/Read-documentation-blue?logo=readthedocs)][docs-module]
[![Changelog](https://img.shields.io/badge/Changelog-Read-blue)](CHANGELOG.md)

A comprehensive, vendor-neutral performance testing toolkit for KubeVirt virtual machines running on OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) or any Kubernetes distribution with KubeVirt.

## Documentation

For detailed documentation, please refer to the [documentation](https://portworx.github.io/virtbench/) website.

## Overview

This suite provides automated performance testing tools to measure and validate KubeVirt VM provisioning, boot times, network readiness, and failure recovery scenarios. It's designed for production environments running OpenShift Virtualization or KubeVirt with any CSI-compatible storage backend.

> **⚠️ Note:** KubeVirt Benchmark is an independent opensource project and is not affiliated with the Linux Foundation or CNCF.

## Features

- **Unified CLI Interface**: Professional kubectl-like CLI (`virtbench`) with shell completion
- **VM Creation Performance Testing**: Measure VM provisioning and boot times at scale
- **Boot Storm Testing**: Test VM startup performance when powering on multiple VMs simultaneously
- **Live Migration Testing**: Measure VM live migration performance across different scenarios
- **Capacity Benchmark Testing**: Test cluster capacity limits with comprehensive VM operations (create, resize, restart, snapshot, migrate)
- **Single Node Testing**: Pin all VMs to a single node for node-level capacity testing
- **Failure and Recovery Testing**: Validate VM recovery times after node failures
- **VM Snapshot Testing**: Test VM snapshot creation and readiness
- **Volume Resize Testing**: Test PVC expansion capabilities
- **Parallel Execution**: Support for testing hundreds of VMs concurrently
- **Parallel Namespace Creation**: Create namespaces in batches for faster test setup
- **Multiple Storage Backends**: Works with any CSI-compatible storage class (Portworx, Ceph, vSphere, AWS EBS, etc.)
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs with timestamps and error tracking
- **Flexible Configuration**: Command-line arguments for easy customization
- **Interactive Results Dashboard**: Auto-generate rich HTML dashboards for all test results
